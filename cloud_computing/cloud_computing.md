## 📌Cloud Computing & Compute Services

### 1. What is Compute?

Compute refers to the processing power required to run applications and workloads in the cloud.
It’s essentially the “brains” of cloud computing – the virtual servers, containers, or serverless functions that execute code and handle requests.

### 2. Examples of AWS Compute Services

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Virtual machines in the cloud with full control.

Lambda – Serverless, event-driven functions.

ECS (Elastic Container Service) – Managed container orchestration.

AWS Batch – Run batch computing jobs at scale.

Fargate – Serverless compute engine for containers.


### 3. Key Concepts

Scalability & Elasticity – Automatically adjust resources up or down.

Serverless – No need to provision or manage servers (e.g., Lambda, Fargate).

Containers – Lightweight, portable, consistent environments for applications (Docker).

Instance Types – Choose based on workload needs (general purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, accelerated computing).

High Availability & Reliability – Redundancy and failover built into AWS infrastructure.

### 4. Reflection

I noticed that serverless and containers are becoming dominant for modern applications, while EC2 remains a core building block for more traditional or highly customized workloads.
